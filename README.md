#emotional-rollercoaster
(it sure was)

## Inspiration

It was 3am, after a brief team meeting we discovered that we had yet again over scoped. We had a functioning emotion reader but nothing to use it with...after some caffeine fueled brainstorming we came up with a e-motion controlled game.

## What it does

The game is like the classic game "Copter" the user must pull different expressions in order to do different actions in the game. Happy moves up, sadness goes down and anger fires! 

## How we built it

We used Microsoft's Emotion API to read the user's emotions and stream them into a Pygame instance. 

## Challenges we ran into

Since we are calling an API, we had to learn about multithreading to get the game to run smoothly. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Salvaging a project!

## What I learned

SCOPE SMALL FOR GOODNESS SAKE!

## What's next for Emotional Rollercoaster

Maybe pretty up the graphics a little, make it look like a rollercoaster with a track generating behind you
